# Our Objectives

We're aiming to create:

1. A standard that the community trusts and supports
1. A community of good practice
1. A resource that stays with you throughout your professional development

    We want to make sure that the fundamentals are covered for each step of your professional career - whether you're just starting out as a digital engineer whether you're running your own company, or any stage inbetween.

    Along the way, we want to help you develop as a professional too.

... for today's digital engineers.
